Configuration management (CM) is crucial in software development as it ensures consistency, traceability, and control over changes in the software system. It helps teams track modifications, manage different versions, and prevent conflicts by maintaining a structured workflow. CM enhances collaboration, reduces errors, and improves deployment efficiency, making software development more reliable and scalable.
